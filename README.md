# write_idea
This app allows the user to record ideas for their writing projects - like blog posts, or articles, rank them, track writing dates, publishing dates, etc.  The key Xojo takeaways for this app are the creation and perpetuation of a SQLite database, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE of records within the database, and basic UI manipulation.  This app was created as part of the #JustCode challenge.  Enjoy!
